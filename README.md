# Hi there, I'm Steven Beatty! 👋 

<!--

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My journey into the world of technology started at the young age of 6 with a Commodore 64 and my passion hasn't faltered since. From scouring yard sales for old floppy disks to the pivotal moment of receiving my first AOL free trial CD, my curiosity for the inner workings of tech was piqued and fostered from the start.

## My Journey 🚀 

My fascination wasn't only restricted to technology; I also had an innate interest in understanding how mechanical objects worked. In high school, my first programming course on Visual Basic exposed me to the intriguing world of programming, while my obsession with engines led me to a career as a diesel technician. I delved into both fields and while they offered different challenges, they equally honed my logic and problem-solving skills.

As I continued my professional journey, I made time for my personal growth, venturing into hobbies and interests that pushed me out of my comfort zone. I decided to learn the 'holy trinity' of front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My journey of self-discovery extended into other interests, like photography, where I delved into wedding photography and worked with photo editing software to create cherished moments for my clients.

Additionally, during the pandemic, I took up mycology and learned about the intricacies of identifying edible plants and mushrooms, underlining my attention to detail. Nowadays, I'm pursuing my A-License in skydiving, with over 6 hours of wind tunnel training, emblematic of my continuous strive to push boundaries and step into the unknown.

## Professional Growth 📚 

This thirst for learning led me to Tech Elevator Pittsburgh, where I threw myself into the realm of object-oriented programming, web application development, web APIs, and component-based front-end frameworks. Over the course of those 14 weeks, not only did I fall in love with the concepts I was learning, but I also found a community of like-minded individuals who shared my passion for growth and learning.

My next endeavor is to continue my journey as a Full Stack Software Developer, where I can integrate my passion for programming, learning, and mentoring. While I continue to further hone my current skills, I am also on the lookout to collaborate with other developers and experiment with new technologies.

## Currently... ⚙️ 

I am currently immersing myself in various projects and constantly learning. Stay tuned to my GitHub profile to see my latest projects and feel free to reach out for collaborations. Together, we can learn, grow and create something great. 

## Let's Connect! 🌐
